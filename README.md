# User Registration Frontend

A modern, responsive user registration and authentication system built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Introduction

- This project is the frontend of a user registration and authentication system.
- Registration form require First/Last name, email, password, and password confirmation. Email format validation and password strength validation are implemented.
- Login form requires email and password. It use the same email validation as registration form, but only chacks if password is not null, because the the backend will do the actual user authentication, here we just skip it st this moment.
- The email/password are stored in the browser's local storage for a pure frontend demo.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Choose one of the following strategies based on your needs:

- **Option A (Clone Strategy)**: For exploring the code, learning, or quick testing (read-only access)
- **Option B (Fork Strategy)**: For contributing back to the project or making your own modifications

---

### 📥 Option A: Clone Strategy (Read-Only Access)

This approach is perfect if you want to:
- Explore and learn from the codebase
- Run the application locally for testing
- Study the implementation without making contributions

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Clone the repository directly**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WangyangYe0512/registion-frontend.git
   cd registion-frontend
   ```

   **Expected outcome**: You should see a new `registion-frontend` folder created in your current directory.

   **Verify**:
   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
   You should see project files like `package.json`, `README.md`, etc.

2. **Install project dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   **Expected outcome**: npm will download and install all required packages. This may take a few minutes.

   **Verify**:
   ```bash
   ls node_modules
   ```
   You should see many folders containing the installed packages.

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Expected outcome**: You should see output similar to:
   ```
   ▲ Next.js 15.3.0
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
   - Ready in 2.3s
   ```

4. **View the application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

   **Expected outcome**: You should see the registration/login interface.

#### 🔧 Troubleshooting for Option A:

- **"git: command not found"**: Install Git following the Prerequisites section
- **"npm: command not found"**: Install Node.js following the Prerequisites section
- **Port 3000 already in use**: Try `npm run dev -- --port 3001` to use a different port
- **Permission errors on macOS/Linux**: Try `sudo npm install` (not recommended) or fix npm permissions

---

### 🍴 Option B: Fork Strategy (For Contributors)

This approach is ideal if you want to:
- Contribute improvements or bug fixes back to the project
- Create your own version of the project
- Collaborate with the development team

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Fork the repository on GitHub**

   a. Visit the [original repository](https://github.com/WangyangYe0512/registion-frontend)

   b. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner

   c. Select your GitHub account as the destination

   **Expected outcome**: You now have a copy of the repository under your GitHub account at `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/registion-frontend`

2. **Clone your forked repository**

   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/registion-frontend.git
   cd registion-frontend
   ```

   **Alternative (SSH - if you set up SSH keys):**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/registion-frontend.git
   cd registion-frontend
   ```

   **Verify**:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should see your fork as the `origin`.

3. **Set up the upstream remote**

   This allows you to sync with the original repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/WangyangYe0512/registion-frontend.git
   ```

   **Verify**:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should now see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (original repo).

4. **Create a development branch**

   ```bash
   # Create and switch to a new branch for your work
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

   # Or if working on a specific development branch
   git checkout -b development
   ```

   **Expected outcome**: You're now on a new branch separate from `main`.

   **Verify**:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
   Your current branch should be highlighted with an asterisk (*).

5. **Install project dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   **Expected outcome**: All dependencies are installed successfully.

6. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Expected outcome**: Development server starts on http://localhost:3000

7. **Make your changes and contribute**

   a. **Make your code changes** using your preferred editor

   b. **Test your changes** by running the application

   c. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: descriptive message about your changes"
   ```

   d. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   e. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Visit your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Fill out the PR description
   - Submit to the **corresponding development branch** of the original repository

#### 🔄 Keeping Your Fork Updated:

```bash
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Switch to your main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

#### 🔧 Troubleshooting for Option B:

- **"Permission denied" when cloning**: Use HTTPS instead of SSH, or set up SSH keys
- **"upstream already exists"**: Skip the upstream setup step
- **Merge conflicts**: Use `git status` to see conflicted files, resolve manually, then commit
- **Can't push to upstream**: You can only push to your fork (`origin`), not the original repo (`upstream`)
